// Ah how to model this game...
// I'm following rules found here: http://jaxgames.com/seq2.htm
// 100 cards on the board. No jacks, so 96 cards and 4 "dead" spaces.
// cardStack has 104 cards in it (all cards).
// Some things note worthing:
// Cards are drawn automatically for players, the "Loss of Card" rule from the link above is irrelevant.
// "Dead cards" are also replaced automatically at the player's turn. No special play through needed for that.
// The 2 decisions above were made since it feels weird to have those rules in a digitalized version and it shouldn't impact learning regardless.

// TO DO:
// Change Board to have 2D array of BoardSlot instead of a std::vector?
//
//
